# :material-radio-handheld: Recommended Hardware

New to Meshtastic? Here's what to buy. No monthly fees, no subscriptions. Just a one-time purchase and you're on the mesh.

!!! tip "Two things you need"
    **1. A handheld radio**. Carry it with you, pairs with your phone via Bluetooth<br>
    **2. A rooftop/attic node**. Put it up high at your home to keep you connected

    That's it. Buy these two things, follow our [Start Here](start-here.md) guide, and you're on the mesh.

## :material-star: Our Top Picks

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-cellphone:{ .lg .middle } __1. Handheld: RAK WisMesh Pocket V2__

    ---

    The best all-around handheld for Arizona. GPS, huge 3200 mAh battery (3+ days), IP66 waterproof, solar charging connector. Pairs with your phone over Bluetooth. Open the Meshtastic app and start messaging.

    **~$89-99**. Upgrade the weak stock antenna to the Muziworks 17cm whip (see Antenna Guide below); it's the single biggest improvement you can make.

    [:material-cart: RAK Store (~$89)](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wismesh-pocket) · [Rokland (~$99)](https://store.rokland.com/products/wismesh-pocket)

-   :material-home-roof:{ .lg .middle } __2. Rooftop: WisMesh Repeater Mini 1W__

    ---

    A community build that drops the RAK 1W Booster Kit into the WisMesh Repeater Mini's solar enclosure: **1W (30 dBm) of TX power** (about 6x a typical node), solar self-sustaining, **no soldering**. Designed and field-tested by **prayingmedic**.

    **~$125-150 in parts**. Every step is documented for first-time builders.

    [:material-tools: Full Build Guide](/docs/wismesh-repeater-mini-1w.html){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

</div>

!!! warning "Rooftop runner-up: Station G2 (~$100-130). Currently sold out"
    The most powerful consumer Meshtastic radio (up to **36.5 dBm / 4.5W**) and our long-time rooftop pick. But it's **sold out and extremely hard to get right now**. Check [B&Q Consulting](https://shop.uniteng.com/product/meshtastic-mesh-device-station-edition/) for restocks; until then, the Repeater Mini 1W build above is the one to get.

!!! warning "Why you need a rooftop node"
    **This is the #1 mistake new users make.** A handheld alone will struggle indoors and at range. Put a node up high and the difference is night and day.

---

## :material-cellphone: Handheld Devices

These radios pair with your phone over Bluetooth so you can type messages on your phone screen. All use the nRF52840 chip (great battery life, Bluetooth only) unless noted.

:material-cart: [LILYGO Store (~$77)](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-deck-plus-meshtastic) | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/LILYGO-ESP32-S3-LORA-89-2-8-inch-Development/dp/B0FBGX1VP5)

---

#### :material-map-marker: Card-Style Trackers

Credit-card-sized GPS trackers with no screen or buttons. Toss one in a backpack, clip it to a pet collar, or leave it in a vehicle. They report location to the mesh automatically.

**Our pick: RAK WisMesh Tag (~$39)**

- **Battery:** 1000 mAh (**5-6 days** typical; 2-3 days with GPS always on)
- **TX Power:** 22 dBm (standard)
- **Waterproof:** IP66

## :material-home-roof: Rooftop / Base Station Nodes

These are permanent nodes mounted high on your roof, attic, or mast. They're the backbone of Arizona's mesh network.

!!! tip "Height is everything"
    **How high your antenna is matters more than how fancy it is.** A basic antenna at 30 feet will almost always outperform an expensive antenna at 6 feet.

!!! info "Arizona climate note"
    Extreme heat (115F+), intense UV, and monsoon storms. Use **waterproof enclosures** (IP67+) and ensure ventilation. The good news: solar panels perform exceptionally well here year-round.

---

#### :material-trophy: Best Overall: WisMesh Repeater Mini 1W (~$125-150)

Our #1 rooftop node. A community build that puts the RAK 1W Booster Kit (RAK3401) inside the WisMesh Repeater Mini's solar enclosure. The 1W board fits the enclosure's standard mounting-plate holes with no modification and **no soldering**, giving you **30 dBm (1W) of TX power**, roughly 6x a typical 22 dBm node, with better receive too thanks to the RAK13302's RF/SAW filter. The low-power nRF52840 plus the Mini's solar panel keep it topped up; prayingmedic's field test held battery voltage in a narrow 3.80-3.84 V band across 5 days mounted vertically on a 10 ft mast.

- **Chip:** nRF52840 + RAK13302 1W LoRa module (with PA + RF/SAW filter)
- **TX Power:** 30 dBm (1W)
- **Power:** Solar (panel built into the donor enclosure) + Li-ion battery. No AC needed
- **WiFi:** No (Bluetooth only)
- **Soldering:** None

**Parts list:**

#### :material-trophy: Most Powerful (When You Can Get One): Station G2 (~$100-130)

The community favorite for serious coverage. Transmits at up to **36.5 dBm (4.5W)** with a dedicated low-noise amplifier for ~4 dB better receive sensitivity than standard radios. This is the node you put on your roof to anchor coverage for your whole neighborhood.

- **Chip:** ESP32-S3 (WiFi + Bluetooth)
- **TX Power:** Up to 36.5 dBm (4.5W)
- **Power:** USB-C (PD) or 9-19VDC external
- **WiFi:** Yes. MQTT gateway capable
- **Screen:** 1.3" OLED

Pair with a [Rokland 5.8 dBi Fiberglass Antenna](https://store.rokland.com/products/5-8-dbi-n-male-omni-outdoor-915-mhz-antenna-large-profile-32-height-for-helium-rak-miner-2-nebra-indoor-bobcat) (~$30-40) and a waterproof enclosure. **Total build: ~$180-220.**

!!! danger "EIRP compliance note"
    At full 36.5 dBm output with a high-gain antenna (5.8+ dBi), you may exceed US ISM 915 MHz EIRP limits. If using a high-gain antenna, reduce TX power in Meshtastic settings to stay compliant.

!!! warning "Sold out and extremely hard to get right now"
    The Station G2 is **sold out and extremely hard to get right now.** It's our #2 rooftop pick for this reason. If you can't track one down, build the WisMesh Repeater Mini 1W above. Check [B&Q Consulting's shop](https://shop.uniteng.com/shop-2/) regularly for restocks.

:material-cart: [B&Q Consulting](https://shop.uniteng.com/product/meshtastic-mesh-device-station-edition/)

---

#### :material-package-variant-closed: Pre-Built Solar Nodes (No Assembly Required)

Don't want to build anything? These come fully assembled. Mount them, configure Meshtastic settings, done.

!!! info "Node role for Arizona rooftop nodes"
    Set your rooftop node to **CLIENT**. This is the recommended role for home installations. See [Additional Settings → Node Roles](additional-settings.md#device) for details on all roles.

!!! warning "Understand Router roles before switching"
    **Router** and **Router Late** are intended for high-elevation, permanent fixed locations with good line-of-sight. Not typical home or rooftop installs. Using these roles in the wrong context can increase congestion and cause routing issues across the shared mesh. If you're considering Router or Router Late, read up on Meshtastic's guidance and ask the community on Discord before switching.

## :material-antenna: Antenna Guide

Your antenna has the single biggest impact on range. More than the radio itself.

#### Which Type?

| Type | What It Does | When to Use It |
|---|---|---|
| **Omnidirectional** | Sends/receives in all directions (360°) | Most rooftop nodes |
| **Directional (yagi)** | Focuses signal in one direction | Bridging two distant nodes |

For most Arizona rooftop nodes, an **omnidirectional fiberglass antenna** is the right choice. **A 5-6 dBi omni is the sweet spot** for residential/suburban deployments.

#### Recommended Antennas

| Antenna | Gain | Price | Best For | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Rokland 5.8 dBi Fiberglass** | 5.8 dBi | ~$30-40 | All-around rooftop (32" tall) | [Buy](https://store.rokland.com/products/5-8-dbi-n-male-omni-outdoor-915-mhz-antenna-large-profile-32-height-for-helium-rak-miner-2-nebra-indoor-bobcat) |

| **RAK WisMesh Blade** | ~3 dBi | ~$15-20 | Budget outdoor | [Buy](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wismesh-antenna) |
| **Muziworks 17cm Whip** | n/a | ~$12 | Handheld upgrade (SMA), best value | [Buy](https://muzi.works/products/whip-antenna-17cm) |
| **MESHTAC 4 dBi Gooseneck** | 4 dBi | ~$20-25 | Handheld upgrade (SMA) | [Buy](https://store.rokland.com/products/meshtac-gooseneck-tactical-antenna-4-dbi-gain-sma-male-915-mhz-flexible-for-meshtastic-lora) |

!!! tip "Keep the cable short"
    Every foot of cable loses a little signal. Use **LMR-240 or better** cable and keep runs to **10 feet or less**. The Rokland antenna kits include quality cable in 6, 10, 15, or 25 foot lengths.

!!! warning "Higher gain = narrower beam"
    An 8-10 dBi antenna focuses signal into a narrow horizontal band, great for flat terrain but bad for hilly areas. If you're in the mountains or have significant elevation changes, stick with 3-5 dBi.
